OO typed grammar sugar for javascripts
Words below are mainly for me. it reminds me the days I still have passions.
This lib was begin as a small tech salon on my way home Apr 1st, 2012, some guys believe that FP is the future of programming language, while me
insistant that OO stil very powerful. as they're .Net and JS programmers, so there was this idea, but the truth is I just read some paper on lambda calculation,
and I still remember the conclusion FP equals Turing, at that time I was reading lots of books regarding compilers,  trying to code some tools based on compilers.

it took me a week for the basic lib and some other days for the GOF design patterns.
